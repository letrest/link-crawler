This is a NextJS app that takes a URL, crawls the page and fetches the same domain links on the page. It's intended to give you a high-level idea of the site including the erorr rate, the cacheability of the site among other things. 

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## TO DO
* Add a slider to add the ability to slow down the crawl in case we get blocked
* Add a summary to show the number of crawled URLs and the error rate, cache hits, etc.
* Add the ability to deepcrawl?
